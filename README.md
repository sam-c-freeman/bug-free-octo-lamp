# Mocktail App

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This project is currently a work in progress but will be completed by October 27th!

Mocktail is an app for craft mocktail recipes.  There are plentiful alcoholic drink apps in the market but hardly anything focusing specifically on non-alcoholic drinks.  I created this app to fill that need.

Mocktail gives the user the ability to add their own recipes, discover recipes from other users and to update the recipes when they find their own specific twist.  There will also be a feature that allows the user to add items they have at home to a "cupboard".  The app will suggest recipes they can make based on the ingredients they already have on hand.

# Mocktail App

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Mocktail is an app for craft mocktail recipes.  There are plentiful alcoholic drink apps in the market but hardly anything focusing specifically on non-alcoholic drinks.  I created this app to fill that need.

Mocktail gives the user the ability to add their own recipes, discover recipes from other users and to update the recipes when they find their own specific twist.  The app also allows users to input ingredients they currently have at home.  It then suggests recipes they can make based on those ingredients!
